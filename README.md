# [Backstage](https://backstage.io)

The porpuse of this repository is to create an image that allows me to quickly test the main features of Backstage.

## Features
- Added support for `mkdocs-techdocs` (backend docker).
- In-memory database, to avoid config a database (data will be lost every time instance is restarted).

To start the app, run:

```sh
yarn install
yarn dev
```
